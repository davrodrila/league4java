league4java
===========

Java wrapper for the League of Legends REST Api. This project uses Gson (https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) to parse 
the JSON retrieved, once you import gson and this classes into your project, its as simple as creating a new LeagueApi("yourApiKey",Region)
and start using the methods that directly query the REST api. POJO's will be retrieved to use in your application.
